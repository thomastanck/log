i just showered btw, the whole time i was showering i was thinking of story ideas, well, magic system ideas

push/pull superpower, bunch of superpowers, reading minds superpower, alchemy, etc but then i couldn't think of a way to make it properly work

except the alchemy one

because the story has to be actually interesting right

i don't want the superpower to interfere with evolution

so then i realised the alchemy one might actually work

because refined metals come very late

so i could set it in 1600+

another story idea i had is to combine any kind of magic with something that makes it so only children can use the magic

and when they grow up they forget the magic

in chapter 0 the protagonist opens up a mysterious letter and it turns out it's a letter from the past

and somehow it's plot relevant

children who know magic but don't have the power to use it (because adults don't help) and adults who have the power to use them but don't know magic (because they forgot)

and the protagonist is the one who sidesteps this trick by sending a letter to the future

and then it turns out the protagonist isn't the only one who has the idea so there's actually a secret conspiracy or something where most adults are unaware of magic but the conspiracy leaders are those who happened to be born magical (very rare) and also had the idea to send a message to the future (also very rare) and this rarity makes it possible to write a story about them

i thought about it and there's a few... patterns to make magic stuff interesting really

first is like harry potter where you got a community of magical ppl and nonmagical people and they're separate

and the cool part happens when they mingle

like harry potter himself, raised by muggles

but then you have to think of ways to keep the nonmagical people unaware of magic and this is made possible because harry potter's magical system makes no sense so they can make whatever spells they want

including a spell to make people forget everything

about magi of course

second is like lord of the rings where you just have the entire universe be magical

but this is tricky because if you want it to make sense then there's too much fucking worldbuilding to do

third is the one universe, but very rare magicians, like in worm, or my forgetting-magic idea

very few people have the ability to use magic

and the people who see them tend to not believe them or somehow explain away the results

those smart enough to see can believe

but the trouble comes with the "getting caught by government agents" scenario

because if they were stupid enough to reveal so much about magic that they could get caught by government agents, then the entire world should be aware of magic

fourth is like my alchemy idea, magic only recently came into existence

this is also in worm, in worm people didn't have superpowers before but they just happened to get them right around the present time

this is also typical of science fiction where "technology" gets so advanced it's basically magic

and some random discovery of "totally not magic" leads them to create really fancy shit

in terms of alchemy it'd be set in the past, right around when refined metals became possible to produce and chemistry became an actual thing

you notice that for every pattern there's always a trick, if you don't handle that trick then the story immediately makes no sense

because if you have the third method where magicians do the forgetting thing, you'd just have your mouth left gaping open at the utter stupidity of the entire world for not noticing magic, unless you had a good way to prevent the whole world from noticing

even saying "oh there's only ONE magician in the entire universe" isn't quite enough

someone would definitely notice if you accidentally used magic at the age of 4

and if you didn't accidentally use magic there comes the question of how you accidentally figure magic out in the first place

and of course there's the question to answer, why is there only one? why can't there be many secret magicians

so there's a lot of weird questions that make it so you can't even BEGIN writing your story if your story has magic in it, because the very start of the story wouldn't even make sense if you don't take care to answer questions

i did kinda assume in the third pattern that the general universe is unaware of magic, this is so technology and history and wars will still be plausibly like our current universe

if people knew about magic, definitely people would try to use magic in wars and definitely there'd be a lot of technology that depends on such magics

and if that were to happen then you become unable to predict what kind of technology there is unless you thought too hard

you'd have to do the equivalent thinking of al the inventors of history combined, which seems like a lot of work

of course you could also just do enough thinking so it's theoretically wrong but good enough that readers don't see the inconsistencies

but you see where i'm getting at right? if you diverge too much from these patterns, you can't even start writing your story because the very initial setting won't make sense

and each pattern has its own restrictions

lord of the rings is probably an example of a kind of magic system (aka pattern 2) that seems to make sense but probably has some possible "but why didn't X just..." plot hole in it, but hides it by sheer complexity

it's interesting, i was originally just thinking "say hypothetically i wanted to write a story, what would i write about"

and i ended up with a series of constraints on the fucking magic system, that says "suppose you do have a magic system, then ALL THESE MAGIC SYSTEMS YOU'RE THINKING OF PROBABLY WON'T EVEN WORK IN THE FIRST PLACE because of XXX"

^-- i thought of this in the shower, lol

that's a lot of things to think about x-x

basically

you don't have to read anything except the last 2 lines really

key point: if you design your magic system wrong, the setting won't even make sense, and tehre'd be a plot hole before your story even starts. e.g. why didn't voldemort just take over the world in 2 days

which is totally possible to do in canon harry potter, btw

the only problem

say you want to write a story that DIDN'T have a magic system

... now you got a whole different set of problems to think about

like it wouldn't be plotholes, but it'd be a question of wtf the characters are even gonna do about their life

the problem is if there's no magic at all, then the knowledge you have about your character's world is the same as the knowledge OTHER people have about your world

because physics, politics, general human behaviour etc does'nt change

so all your characters have to behave in a way that makes sense

which is very difficult

say you wanted to write a day of the characters living their lives

then you have to simulate each character, say 5 characters, going through their day

and suppose you were so smart that you can simulate the character at a 1:1 time ratio, aka it takes you only a day to think about every single decision and thought each character makes

then just writing 1 day of story takes 5 days

which is clearly impractical, so you need to take shortcuts and guess and shit

then that's not even getting started on the story idea, what the characters are gonna go through and the story progression and what not

gosh it's basically impossible to write without plot holes

how does anyone even write anything

of course i'm assuming the goal is to actually write without plot holes

if you didn't care much about plot holes... the set of constraints changes, and now you're looking for compelling characters and a compelling story to tell

which still again has its own set of constraints, it wouldn't do to have an overly silly story that has too many plotholes

actually i just realised, what i said above will STILL stand

because if you try to reduce the number of plot holes

it's really the same problem as asking "how do i not have plot holes at all"

it'd just make even less sense if you write your story without caring then slowly patched all the plot holes

there'd just be no way to patch all of it and every patch probably creates more, like how telling a lie, then covering it up with another lie, creates a snowball effect of lies, except instead of lies you have plotholes

so you probably want to start with "no plotholes" then slowly add plotholes in in subtle ways (or just simply because you don't notice every plot hole) to actually write a story

ok ya i shouldn't spend so much time thinking about plots and plot holes

lesson learnt: story writing is hard, one of the reasons being it's very hard to even come up with a story to write about... if you just jump in, you end up dying due to the Plot Hole Death Spiral
