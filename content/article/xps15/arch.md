+++

After using Ubuntu for just a few days,
I was already sick of installing loads of ppas
just to get the packages I wanted.
Some of those ppas were even available in the main repositories,
but they lacked bug fixes
so I had to install the ppas.
That's when I decided that
I really hate Ubuntu
and I would try to go for something like
Arch Linux
with its rolling release.

If you're a seasoned Arch Linux user,
the Arch [wiki article](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dell_XPS_15_9560)
contains everything you need to know.

However,
if you're a Linux n00b like me,
this article may be useful.

# Pre-installation

As I've written about in my
[Ubuntu and Windows dualbooting article](post/xps15/dualboot/),
you need to change some BIOS settings
as well as some Windows options
in order to boot into Arch Linux properly.
If you want to dual boot Windows,
you may have to reinstall Windows
(as I have,
since I don't like the idea of a
Dell-shipped Windows installation)
or fix Windows.
You may want to Google for a Windows fix
if you don't want to reinstall.
