Interesting *(read: annoying)* thing I found
is that if you use Ctrl+L to select the address bar in Firefox,
the URL doesn't actually go in the selection (primary) buffer.
You have to physically select it for it to work.

Luckily,
the workaround is to simply Ctrl+C the address bar
after using Ctrl+L to select it.
`autocutsel` will then sync the buffers
and now you have the URL in both buffers!
yay.
