It was very interesting poking into the `find` man page.
That page is extremely long!

The cddots commands originaly made by [my friend mort](https://github.com/mortie/nixConf/commit/7c368e6392e31b638d8f6282a159e263303ecadc)
is really a family of aliases
`..` `...`, and so on
that `cd` upwards.
If given an argument
it then `cd` downwards into that directory.

I noticed that it couldn't tab-complete
since bash doesn't know
that these commands are really `cd`
from a different (higher) working directory.
Since I wanted to learn to use `..` more often,
seeing this behaviour made me not want to use it anymore,
up until I thought
maybe I should just make a bash completion script for it.

This experience ended up taking mor time than it would ever save,
but hey, I learnt something new today!
