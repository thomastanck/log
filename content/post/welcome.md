Welcome to my log. Here I'll be posting many links to sites with a record of my thoughts and comments on such articles, with occasional long form articles (which I predict I will never actually get around to). In a way, this is just a [tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com) replacement. However, I think there was merit in learning how to set up a microblog with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), so this was absolutely not a waste of time.

*/me stops rationalising*

It's not called a *blog* because in the usual sense of the word, that implies longer form articles. It is not called *"microblog"* as I think that's a mouthful to type. Hence, it is called a *log*, in the sense of a computer log, just more human.

Anyways, have fun reading this *log*, I guess.
